#Hi There, I'm James!

I'm a highschooler from Canada who likes learning about coding and programming but still has a lot to learn.

My biggest projects right now are Penguin_Pad and Penguin_Paddle, both Hackclub YSWSs

I'm currents working on creating a version of sabbac from star wars that can be played in a web browser which is proving challengeing
